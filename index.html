    <h1>The practice of telling about someone’s future through some “gift” or supernatural or divine powers. </h1>
    <p>Common methods used for fortune telling in Europe and the Americas include astromancy, horary astrology, pendulum reading, Spirit board reading, tasseography (reading tea leaves in a cup), cartomancy (fortune telling with cards), tarot reading, crystallomancy (reading of a crystal sphere), chiromancy (palmistry, reading of the palms), the last three have traditional associations in the popular mind with the Roma and Sinti people who are often called “gypsies”.</p>
    <p>Another form of fortune telling, sometimes called “reading” 
    or “spiritual consultation”, does not rely on specific devices or methods, but rather the practitioner gives the client advice and predictions which are said to have come from spirits or in visions.</p>

    <h1>Being looked down on for the winnings.</h1> <p>Steve Granger won $900,000 in the West Virginia Lottery in September of 2005, and, after paying the taxes, “put most of it away for his and his wife’s retirement,” writes Oren Dorell in USA Today. But along with everyone knowing his business, everyone asking for investments, and everyone grabbing at him because he was suddenly considered “lucky,” there are the lotto snobs, too. He once heard “someone say in an ugly tone, ‘There go those lottery people,’ as he and his wife passed by.”</p><br>
   
    <div class="footnote">*We also asked about their happiness, and for happiness we found there’s no strong evidence that lottery winners are happier in the long run, but there is strong evidence that they are more satisfied with their lives in the long run.

    <h1>Satiation Points across Gender and Education</h1> <p>This study examined the issue of income satiation; that is, whether there is a level of income after which more money no longer brings more happiness. This topic has implications for individuals, organizations and governments, as well as informing our understanding of the overall association between income and happiness. We found that satiation is a ubiquitous phenomenon for all three measures of well-being</p><br>
   
    <div class="footnote">**refers to what one thinks about his or her life satisfaction in global terms (life as a whole) and in domain terms (in specific areas of life such as work, relationships, etc.). Life satisfaction can be measured using a questionnaire such as the 5 item satisfaction with life questionnaire

    <h1>Manifest Destiny is a phrase coined in 1845.</h1> <p>It is the idea that the United States is destined—by God, its advocates believed—to expand its dominion and spread democracy and capitalism across the entire North American continent. The philosophy drove 19th-century U.S. territorial expansion and was used to justify the forced removal of Native Americans and other groups from their homes. The rapid expansion of the United States intensified the issue of slavery as new states were added to the Union, leading to the outbreak of the Civil War.
